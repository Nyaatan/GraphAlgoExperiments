It's a simple program testing the execution time of various graph alghorithms solving two problems:
Minimal Spanning Tree Problem:
  -Prim's alghorithm
  -Kruskal's algorithm
Shortest Path Problem:
  -Dijkstra's algorithm
  -Ford-Bellman's algorithm
Program allows plotting the graphs and results of agorithms, as well as generating randomized graphs.
Testing process for serial tests with many randomized entries is fully automated.
